## About Me
I am a graduate student at the Zicklin School of Business, finalizing my Master's of Science with a concentration in Data Analytics. I expect to graduate in December 2024. Through my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. My portfolio showcases a range of projects that highlight my skills in data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges and contribute to data-driven decision-making in a professional setting.
