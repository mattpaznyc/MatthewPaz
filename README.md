# Portfolio

## About Me
I am a graduate student at the Zicklin School of Business, finalizing my Master's of Science with a concentration in Data Analytics. I expect to graduate in December 2024. Through my studies, I have developed a strong foundation in data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. My portfolio showcases a range of projects that highlight my skills in data exploration, visualization, and predictive modeling. I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills to real-world challenges and contribute to data-driven decision-making in a professional setting.

## Projects
## Marketing Binary Classification Project

This project focuses on building and evaluating binary classification models to predict whether a consumer will respond to an offer from a sales campaign, with a binary target variable representing acceptance (1) or not-accepted (0). The analysis involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model selection, and performance evaluation.

### R Packages Used
- dplyr
- ggplot2
- caret
- pROC
- e1071
- RColorBrewer
- ROSE
- ggcorrplot
